# playlist-downloader
Quick and dirty spotify playlist downloader

How to use:

Run the main.py script as follows with the absolute path of a csv file for import
e.g:
python -e main.py /the/absolute/path/of/csv.csv

If it can't get the correct location, it will ask for the full file.

Within the same folder the script is run in, it will generate the playlist in it's own folder.
Each file will have the youtube ID as it's name.


Process summary:
Input - CSV as generated by exportify

Pulls relevant data from the CSV, stores it in relevant lists
Runs through each list, searches youtube for the song, downloads first result
Applies metadata to each song, generates .txt file for iTunes to read and import

At this stage, still in alpha v0.1
Python version 3.9.5

It's a bodge, but it works
